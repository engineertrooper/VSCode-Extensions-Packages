# VSCode Extensions Packages for Projects

```A collection of extensions to create a workspace for your next project.```
 
Hey there, welcome to the VSCode Extensions Packs repository. If you search for classic work environment for your next code or documentation project you will most likly find it here.

Feel free to copy, change, recommened, add or open an issue to the repository.

## How to Use?

0. VSCode has the feature to install extensions via a ```extensions.json```. With that it is easier to change the workspace to  correct settings of the project. ([More information](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_workspace-recommended-extensions))

1. Place an ```extensions.json``` inside your ```.vscode``` directory. If there is no directory inside your current project, add the directory. (Make sure to write the ``` . ``` as well!)

2. Then copy one of the ```<name>.json ``` files and rename them to ```extensions.json``` or copy the code directly from your browser to a new created ```extensions.json``` file on your computer.

3. Reload or restart your VSCode! The program should ask you to install extensions now or will install automatically all needed extensions.

4. Sometimes Installed-Extensions are disabled, because there were install in past and then disabled. Please check if all extensions required are installed and enable, also all other extensions disabled if not recommended. Sometimes that can cause problems if you have many extensions working beside each other.
